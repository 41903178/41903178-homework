- User Space—applications
- Kernel Space—process manager, memory manager, file manager, I/O manager
- file system—major one is NTFS-
- ReFS
- I/O Management--Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for output of data
- Encryption; Faster access speeds; Security
- Block storage--Improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker
